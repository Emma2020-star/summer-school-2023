# Fine-tuning AI flood mapping models using GFMs

Some notes should go here.


## Setup
The passing of data, configurations and pre-trained weights from the GFM are handled through a shared folder.  This can be mounted here


### Data
For data and labels used to train the fine-tuned model should be stored in the data folder
